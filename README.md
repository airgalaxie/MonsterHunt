# MonsterHunt

This frok is updated by [erlendir](https://github.com/erlendir/MonsterHunt "erlendir") for the work in Bukkit/Spigot 1.9 - 1.12. x Minecraft Server

If you want to use it by yourself feel free to do so. 

There will be no support.

You can download the built Jar-file [here](http://puu.sh/nzfk6/7d2f1d2231.jar "monsterhunt.jar")

To build the Project your own, you need the Vault PlugIn, which you can find here:
http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/vault/

Thanks to [matejdro](https://github.com/matejdro "matejdro") for this PlugIn!
