# MonsterHunt

I updated this PlugIn to work on Spigot 1.9 to use it by myself. 

If you want to use it by yourself feel free to do so. 

There will be no support.

You can download the file [here](http://puu.sh/nzfk6/7d2f1d2231.jar "monsterhunt.jar")

To build the Project you need the Vault PlugIn, which you can find here:

Thanks to [matejdro](https://github.com/matejdro "matejdro") for this PlugIn!
